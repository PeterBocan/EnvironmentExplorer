EnvironmentExplorer
===================

Environment Explorer is supposed to make programmer's life easier with handling environment variables on Windows. 
*There is no binary output due to size of Qt dependencies* (well, program itself has only 100kB (x64, release)) 

thus download sources and compile it with Qt 5.1 or higher.
